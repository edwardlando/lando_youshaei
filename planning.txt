shopping cart question - called skimlinks and they said it's not possible - could ou make a list of links?

hover over squares - expand


Viraj's advice - 
Don't perform the same query again and again.
Once you have done that search, make sure to store it persistently - that way if some other user does the same channel, pull up that info and only filter the newer stuff.

When the tastemaker submits the item filter then - could have a table of each of the permutations of the channel. Have the item already filter. 
Maybe use memcache or some other thing to load a bunch of items.
Pull them 5 at a time or whatever when the user starts clicking, or run it as a background process. Already start pulling the next one.

background process - look at ruby task queue - background job

error with the current_channel
